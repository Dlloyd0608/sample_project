- **SPA02:** Multi-language "Hello World" (20+ languages, RTL support)

## Getting Started
1. Clone or browse this repository
2. Open `src/spa01/index.html` or `src/spa02/index.html` in a browser
3. Check `docs/` folder for full documentation

## Documentation
- [Project Overview](docs/project_overview.md) - Purpose, goals, scope
- [Requirements](docs/requirements.md) - Detailed specifications
- [Session Log](docs/session_log.md) - Development progress across chats

## Tech Stack

- Proper UTF-8 and RTL text handling
```

## Step 4: Verify Setup

Once you've created these files on GitHub:

1. Go to your repository URL: `https://github.com/yourusername/sample_project`
2. Verify all files are visible
3. Click on `docs/project_overview.md` and copy the URL from your browser
4. It should look like: `https://github.com/yourusername/sample_project/blob/main/docs/project_overview.md`

## Step 5: Start Chat 01 (This Chat!)

**Your message to start working:**
```
I've created a GitHub project at https://github.com/yourusername/sample_project

Please fetch and review:
1. docs/project_overview.md
2. docs/requirements.md
3. docs/session_log.md

Confirm you understand the project, then generate a continuity brief for Chat 02.
